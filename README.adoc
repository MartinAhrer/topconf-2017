== Setup

For participating in the workshop you are required to have a Docker host operated by a cloud provider of your choice.

If no cloud provider account exists, I'm recommending Digital Ocean as it is very simmple.
Using this https://m.do.co/c/e30a2ecd1271[referral link] you are credited 10$ which is sufficient for the workshop.

The host should run a Docker engine (1.13 is latest as of today) and you should be able to either connect to this host via SSH or using `docker-machine`.
Further the host must have `git` and `docker-compose`.

.Installing docker-compose
[source,shell]
----
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.10.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
